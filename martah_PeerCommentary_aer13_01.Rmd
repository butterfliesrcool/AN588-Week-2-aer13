~~## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:~~

`~~{r cars}
summary(cars)~~`

~~## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:~~

`~~{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)~~`

~~Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.~~
__This whole section can be deleted (except maybe that first chunk if you wan it to run things for your whole page) if you want a shorter code? -M__

## CHALLENGE 1
#ASSIGNMENT: First, create a vector of 1, word character strings comprising the first line of the novel Ulysses, by James Joyce: “Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.” Then, extract every third element of this vector.

v1 <- c("Stately,", "plump", "Buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead,", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed.")
v1
matrix(data = v1, ncol = 1)
v1[seq(from = 1, to = 22, by = 3)] #create a sequence of every third element in the vector "v1"
```
__I'm not sure what the `matrix()` function does in this chunk? I think you can run the sequence just how you did without converting it into a matrix. -M__  

__Also, just a formatting tip, if you put the headers outside of your chunk it helps to organize your document and find challenges on the toc easier :) -M__  

```{r}
##CHALLENGE 2
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
x <- m[, c(2,3,6) ]
x
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable x
x2 <- m[c(6, 8), ]
x2
#Given the matrix, m, above, extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x
x3 <- m[2:6, 2:9]
x3
```
__Really great code! -M__  

```{r}
##CHALLENGE 3
#Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5 x 5 x 4 x 4) named a consisting of the numbers 400 to 1 (i.e., a descending series)
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a

#Given this matrix, what would the following return?

a[1, 1, 1, 2] #300

a[2, 3, 2, ] #364, 264, 164, 64

a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3] #     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
                  #     [1,]  150  145  140  135  130
                  #     [2,]  149  144  139  134  129
                  #     [3,]  148  143  138  133  128
                  #     [4,]  147  142  137  132  127
                  #     [5,]  146  141  136  131  126
```
__again! great code I don't see any fixes -M__

##CHALLENGE 4
#Create a list representing this (simplified) primate taxonomy:
Lemuroidea <- c("Cheirogaleidae", "Lepilemuridae", "Indriidae", "Lemuridae",
    "Daubentoniidae")
Lorisoidea <- c("Lorisidae", "Galagidae")
Strepsirhini <- list(Lemuroidea, Lorisoidea)
names(Strepsirhini) <- list("Lemuroidea", "Lorisoidea")
Strepsirhini

Platyrrhini <- c("Cebidae", "Atelidae", "Pitheciidae")
Catarrhini <- c("Cercopithecidae", "Hylobatidae", "Hominidae") 

Anthropoidea <- list(Platyrrhini,  Catarrhini)
names(Anthropoidea) <- list("Platyrrhini", "Catarrhini")
Anthropoidea

Tarsioidea <- c("Tarsiidae")

Haplorhini <- list(Anthropoidea, Tarsioidea)

##CHALLENGE 5
#Store the following numbers as a 5 x 3 matrix, called “m3”: 3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2. Be sure to fill the matrix ROW-WISE.

m3 <- matrix(data = c(3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2), nrow = 5, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m3

#Coerce the matrix to a data frame.
m3.df <- as.data.frame(m3)
m3.df
#As a data frame, coerce the second column to be logical-valued
m3_sec_col <- m3.df$V2
m3_sec_col_log <- as.numeric(m3_sec_col)
is.numeric(m3_sec_col_log)
#As a data frame, coerce the third column to be factor-valued
m3_third_col_fac <- as.factor(m3.df$V3)
is.factor(m3_third_col_fac) #Problem: is there a way for this change to register in the main m3.df dataframe without adding a new column? 
#When you are done, use the str() command to show the data type for each variable in your dataframe.
m3.df <- cbind(m3.df, m3_third_col_fac = c("1", "2", "1", "1", "2"))
str(m3.df)
```
__for your problem you can just skip assigning a new variable by assigning the column itself the argument. I think there is more ways than one for this but as an example i did:  
`df[, 2],<-as.logical(df[, 2])`  
same thing for the factor coercion -M__

## Peer Commentary 

-I think your code is looking great! My biggest critiques are actually very small. I think the code itself would be easier to navigate if you included some of the html elements prof. schmitt was talking about like the headers and stuff. Also, in challenge 5 I think you can omit creating extra variables by assigning the functions to the elements you are manipulating and cut out that extra step.  
- Other than that, killer code! I hope I get the chance to comment on your code again in the future!
